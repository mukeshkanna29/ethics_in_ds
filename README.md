**Title: Ethical AI News Summarizer - Detailed Documentation**

# 1. Introduction
The AI News Summarizer is a prototype that demonstrates the responsible usage of Generative AI for news summarization while emphasizing ethical considerations such as bias mitigation, transparency, and fairness.

# 2. Ethical Considerations
### **Bias Detection & Mitigation:**
- Preprocessing removes stopwords and standardizes text to prevent biases linked to specific linguistic structures.
- TF-IDF ensures summaries are based on key information rather than sensationalism.

### **Explainability:**
- Uses an interpretable approach (TF-IDF and cosine similarity) to summarize articles without black-box AI models.
- Outputs can be traced back to the highest-ranked sentences in the source document.

### **Data Privacy:**
- No personal or sensitive data is collected.
- The system does not store or share input data.

### **Misinformation Prevention:**
- Relies on original article text, ensuring that generated summaries remain accurate to the source content.

### **Regulatory Compliance:**
- Aligns with AI Ethics Guidelines, avoiding deceptive outputs and ensuring transparency.

# 3. Implementation
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries Used:** NLTK, scikit-learn, NumPy
- **Methodology:** TF-IDF and cosine similarity are used to generate summaries based on key sentence relevance.

## **Code Implementation**
```python
import nltk
import re
import string
import numpy as np
from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize, word_tokenize
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

# Download necessary resources
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
stop_words = set(nltk.corpus.stopwords.words('english'))

def preprocess_text(text):
    """Cleans and tokenizes text, removing stopwords and punctuation."""
    text = text.lower()
    text = re.sub(f"[{string.punctuation}]", "", text)
    words = word_tokenize(text)
    return [word for word in words if word not in stop_words]

def generate_summary(text, num_sentences=3):
    """Generates a summary using TF-IDF and cosine similarity."""
    sentences = sent_tokenize(text)
    if len(sentences) <= num_sentences:
        return text  # Return original if too short
    
    vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(tokenizer=preprocess_text, stop_words='english')
    tfidf_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform(sentences)
    similarity_matrix = cosine_similarity(tfidf_matrix, tfidf_matrix)
    
    sentence_scores = np.sum(similarity_matrix, axis=1)
    ranked_sentences = [sentences[i] for i in np.argsort(sentence_scores)[-num_sentences:]]
    
    return ' '.join(ranked_sentences)

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    news_article = """Your input news article text here..."""
    summary = generate_summary(news_article)
    print("Summary:", summary)
```

## **Sample Output**
```plaintext
Summary: Key sentences extracted from the input text
```

# 4. Risk Assessment
Using Fairness-Aware ML principles, potential risks were evaluated:
| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|---------------------|
| Algorithmic bias | Standardized text processing & stopword removal |
| Lack of transparency | Use of interpretable summarization techniques |
| Data privacy concerns | No data storage or sharing |
| Misinformation risk | Summaries derived directly from source text |

# 5. Transparency & Accountability
- The summarization approach is explainable, ensuring end-users understand why certain sentences were selected.
- The open-source nature allows scrutiny and improvement by the community.

# 6. Evaluation & Testing
### **Methodologies:**
- **Fairness Testing:** Assess summaries across diverse news sources.
- **Bias Evaluation:** Compare generated summaries with the full text.
- **Ethical Compliance Check:** Ensure summaries do not alter or misrepresent the original intent.

# 7. Version Control
- Project is maintained using Git (GitHub/GitLab) for transparency and tracking improvements.

# 8. Conclusion
This project showcases responsible AI implementation for news summarization, focusing on fairness, transparency, and ethical safeguards.
